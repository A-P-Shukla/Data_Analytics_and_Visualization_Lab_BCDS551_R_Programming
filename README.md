## List of Experiments

This repository contains the R programs for the following 10 experiments:

1.  **Array Operations:** A program to define an array and perform basic operations like finding the maximum, minimum, average, sum, square root, and rounding elements.

2.  **File I/O Operations:** Implementation of reading and writing data across different formats including CSV, Text (tab-separated), and Excel (using `readxl` and `writexl` libraries).

3.  **Matrix Manipulations:** A program demonstrating matrix creation and operations such as addition, subtraction, matrix multiplication, and calculating the inverse of a matrix.

4.  **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculation of central tendency measures (Mean, Median, Mode) and dispersion (Standard Deviation) for numeric vectors in R.

5.  **Data Cleaning and Normalization:** A program for handling missing values (NA) by replacing them with the column mean and performing Min-Max normalization on the dataset.

6.  **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Dimensionality reduction on housing data using PCA, including data standardization and variance explanation visualization with `ggplot2`.

7.  **Simple Linear Regression:** Building a linear regression model using the `mtcars` dataset to predict MPG based on Horsepower, including visualization of the regression line.

8.  **K-Means Clustering:** Implementing unsupervised learning on the `iris` dataset to group data points into 3 clusters based on sepal dimensions, visualized using `ggplot2`.

9.  **Web Scraping and API Handling:** Scraping quotes from a website using `rvest`, fetching COVID-19 summary data via a REST API with `httr`, and processing JSON responses.

10. **Association Rule Mining:** Using the `arules` package to perform Market Basket Analysis, generating association rules with the Apriori algorithm and evaluating model accuracy.

## How to Use

Each experiment's source code is contained within the corresponding `exp[N].R` file. You can run these scripts in any R environment (like RStudio) to see the output and visualizations.
